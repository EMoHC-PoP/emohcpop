  <h3 class="section-heading">Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    The Prince of Peace Community welcomes and thanks you for answering the call
    to serve as Extraordinary Ministers of Holy Communion (EMoHC).
  </p>
  <p">
    As Catholics, we truly believe in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ
    in the consecrated Host and Wine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our body language, prayerful attitude and reverent treatment of the Sacred Vessels, the Body of Christ,
    and His Precious Blood helps to support the overall sense of reverence at Holy Communion.
  </p>
  <p>
    When people see us genuflect before the Tabernacle and bow before we receive Holy Communion,
    they are reminded of the correct behaviors and proper reverence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yes, Jesus is truly present in the Tabernacle. Yes, we will be holding and giving the Body, Soul and Divinity
    of Jesus and yes, we will be serving the real Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
  </p>
  <p>
    As EMoHC we must be ever mindful of who we are about to receive and who we are about to touch.
    We pray that God will fill us with a devout and reverent spirit as we offer The Body and Blood of Jesus Christ
    to others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our leadership in prayer, reverence, adoration and service in the parish reminds people
    of the Real Presence of Jesus.

  <h3 class="section-heading">General Information</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Ordinary Ministers of Holy Communion are those who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders
      (bishops, priests, and deacons).
    </li>

    <li>
      An Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion (EMoHC) is a non-ordained person who is commissioned
      to assist priests and deacons in administering Holy Communion.
    </li>

    <li>
      EMoHC help with the distribution of Holy Communion within Mass when there are a large number of communicants.
    </li>

    <li>
      EMoHC may also administer Holy Communion outside of Mass to those impeded from or unable to attend Mass
      due to sickness or physical weakness.
    </li>

    <li>
      EMoHC are not to serve at mass more than twice in one day, and are not permitted
      to receive Holy Communion more than twice in one day.
    </li>

    <li>
      EMoHC are designated for service in their own parish or specified institution
      and therefore are not authorized to exercise this ministry in other parishes or institutions.
      The boundaries of the Prince of Peace service area are determined by the Archdiocese of San Antonio.
    </li>

    <li>
      When serving, EMoHC should always be dressed in a manner consistent with the dignity of their role.
      A neat and modest appearance and reverential deportment are always essential.
      For your safety we suggest footwear that will accommodate the usage of steps.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Procedures for Mass</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Prayer:</strong> When serving, we suggest that you arrive <strong>30 minutes</strong> before Mass
      to allow for personal prayer time and to prepare yourself to serve.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Sign in:</strong> EMoHC should sign in before serving.
      The sign in sheet is located in the Altar Servers Room on a clipboard.
      Please clearly print your initials next to your name.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>EMoHC Lanyards:</strong> On the wall next to the clipboard, you will find lanyards. 
      EMoHC Pendants description: White cross with gold and the words Extraordinary Ministers 
      of Holy Communion imprinted in the circle. 
      EMoHC distributing the <strong>Body of Christ must wear a Lanyard with a black rope</strong>. 
      EMoHC distributing the <span><strong style="color:#ff0000;">Precious Blood of Christ 
      must wear a Lanyard with a red rope></strong></span>.
      <br><br>
      <mark>Please remember to return your Lanyard before leaving the Church.</mark> 
      These lanyards are purchased by Prince of Peace and are the property of the church. 
      If you accidently leave the church with a lanyard, please return it as soon as possible. 
    </li>

    <div class="page-number">Page 2</div>
    <hr class="page-separator"/>
  
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with your serving position.
    </li>

    <li>
      At the time of your mass, your position assignment may need to be changed.
      The Mass Coordinator will inform you if there are any changes to your assignment.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Seating In Mass</h3>

  <p>
    EMoHC are seated in the assembly until the time they approach the Altar to assist in the distribution
    of Holy Communion.
    EMoHC should sit in a pew with access to the middle aisle so they may easily approach the Altar
    without drawing attention.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Approaching the Altar</h3>

  <p>
    During the Communion Rite, the Priest holds up the consecrated Host and says &quot;Behold the Lamb of God,
    behold him who takes away the sins of the world.
    Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.&quot
  </p>
  <p>
    The congregation responds with the prayer &quot;Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,
    but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    As soon as that prayer is completed, Eucharistic Ministers should walk to the front, bow before the Altar,
    and proceed to stand in a line along the front of the Altar to receive communion.
    It is important that you line up according to your Mass and the position you are serving
    as shown in the diagrams below.
    Approach the Altar <strong>silently</strong> and <strong>reverently.</strong>
  </p>

  <img class="image-receiving" alt="Receiving Communion" src="./images/doc-receiving-2.jpg"/>

  <img class="image-receiving" alt="Receiving Communion" src="./images/doc-receiving-1.jpg"/>

  <div class="page-number">Page 3</div>
  <hr class="page-separator"/>

  <p>
    After Communion, each EMoHC will receive a Ciborium or a Chalice from the hands
    of a Priest or Deacon.
    You do not come up to the Altar and take the sacred vessels yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first person to receive the Body of Christ from the Priest is W1.
    The Priest will then continue down the rest of the line serving the Body of Christ, moving from right to left.
  </p>
  <p>
    After W1 consumes the Body of Christ, Deacon will serve W1 the Precious Blood.
    W1 will then keep the Chalice and follow the Priest down the line serving the Precious Blood
    to the rest of the Eucharistic Ministers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meanwhile, a Deacon or the Priest will hand each Eucharistic Minister a Ciborium or a Chalice
    when they finish Holy Communion, after which they can move to their assigned position and begin serving.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Giving the Sacred Body of Christ</h3>

  <p>
    As each communicant approaches, the EMoHC presents the consecrated Host and says, "The Body of Christ."
    After the communicant responds with "Amen," the Eucharistic Minister
    places the Host on the communicant's tongue or in the communicant's hand.
    No other words should be added.
    The decision to receive the host on the tongue or in the hand is made by the communicant,
    not the Eucharistic Minister.
    Special care should be taken to ensure that the Body of Christ is consumed by the communicant
    in the presence of the Eucharistic Minister, so that no one walks away
    without consuming the Body of Christ.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Giving the Precious Blood of Christ</h3>

  <p>
    As each communicant approaches, the EMoHC presents the Chalice and says, "The Blood of Christ."
    After the communicant responds with "Amen," the Eucharistic Minister hands the Chalice to the communicant.
    After each communicant has consumed the Precious Blood, the Eucharistic Minister
    wipes the rim of the Chalice with the Purificator.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">The Traveling Ciborium and Chalice (H5 and W5)</h3>

  <p>
    The procedures for The Traveling Ciborium and Chalice are not the same at all masses.
    Please ask your Mass Coordinator for specific instructions.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">After Administering the Body of Christ (H1 - H5)</h3>

  <p>
    After Communion, Ciboriums are returned to the <strong>left side</strong> of the Altar.
    <strong>DO NOT WALK BEHIND THE ALTAR.</strong>
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      If a Deacon or Priest are at the Altar to receive the Ciborium, hand the Deacon or Priest your Ciborium
      and make a small bow.
      Otherwise, leave the Ciborium on the <strong>left side</strong> of the Altar and make a small bow.
    </li>

    <li>
      Proceed to the Credence Table and dip your fingers in the small bowl of water. 
      Then dry your fingers with the white towel next to the bowl. 
    </li>

    <li>
      Make a small bow at the Credence Table when you are done.
      When you reach the bottom of the steps, turn around and make a small bow to the altar.
      Then return to your seat in the pews.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="page-number">Page 5</div>
  <hr class="page-separator"/>

  <h3 class="section-heading">After Administering the Precious Blood of Christ (W1 - W5)</h3>

  <p>
    After Communion, Chalices are returned to the Credence Table.
    <strong>DO NOT WALK BEHIND THE ALTAR.</strong>
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Chalices and Purificators should be returned to the Credence Table.
    </li>

    <li>
      You should consume any Precious Blood remaining in your Chalice before placing the empty Chalice on the table.
    </li>

    <li>
      Make a small bow at the Credence Table when you are done.
      When you reach the bottom of the steps, turn around and make a small bow to the altar.
      Then return to your seat in the pews.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p class="c8 c10">
    <span class="c12 c21 c27"></span>
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">SITUATIONS</h3>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Communicants Unable to Receive Holy Communion</h3>

  <p>
    The faithful who are unable to receive Holy Communion will sometimes approach the EMoHC
    with their arms crossed over their chest indicating their desire to receive a blessing.
  </p>

  <p>
    <mark>EMoHC are not to extend their hand to offer a blessing
    and should not physically touch the person.</mark>
    Instead, you should say the following words, without a gesture:
    <strong>"Receive our Lord Jesus Christ into your heart."</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>When You Run Out of Consecrated Hosts or Precious Blood</h3>

  <p>
    If you run out of consecrated Hosts while people are still in line, ask them to wait.
    Go to the Priest or Deacon and ask for more Hosts.
    Then return to your position and resume serving.</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you run out of Precious Blood while people are still in line,
    stop serving and return your Chalice to the Credence Table.
  </p>

  <h3>If the Body of Christ Is Dropped</h3>

  <p>
    If a consecrated Host accidentally falls to the floor, first, pick it up.
    At that point you have two options:</span>
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Consume the Host yourself and then continue with communion as normal. No other action is required.
    </li>

    <div class="page-number">Page 6</div>
    <hr class="page-separator"/>

    <li>
      If you would prefer not to consume the Host, set the dropped Body of Christ to the side in your Ciborium
      and continue serving communion.
      When you are finished serving, return your Ciborium to the Altar and set the dropped Body of Christ on the Corporal.
      Inform the Priest or Deacon at the Altar that the Body of Christ fell onto the floor.
      The Priest or Deacon will take care of the dropped Body of Christ.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>What should the EMoHC do if their fingers make contact with the Communicant’s tongue or mouth?</h3>

  <p>
    Continue serving.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What Should the EMoHC do when the Communicant Rejects 
    or Spits Out the Eucharist and Returns It to the EMoHC?
  </h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Put the Eucharist back in the Ciborium, keeping it separated from the other Hosts, and continue serving.
    </li>

    <p style="text-align: center;">OR</p>

    <li>
      Stop serving, take the Eucharist to the Altar and leave the Body of Christ on the Corporal. 
      Then return to your position and continue serving Communion. 
      The Priest or Deacon will take care of the rejected Host. 
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>If the Precious Blood of Christ Is Spilled</h3>

  <p>
    If the Precious Blood is spilled, immediately cover the spill with your Purificator.
    Ask an usher to stand by the spill to make sure that no one steps on the Purificator.
    Go back to the Credence Table and get another Purificator.
    If there is no extra Purificator there, ask the Altar Server to get one for you.
    Then return to your position and resume serving the Precious Blood. 
    When you are done serving, return your Chalice to the Credence Table and inform the Priest or Deacon of the incident.
    They will make sure that the Precious Blood of Christ is properly cleaned.
  </p>
  
  <h3>You Are Serving the Body of Christ and Someone With a Pyx Asks You for Consecrated Hosts From Your Ciborium</h3>

  <p>
    If you are serving the Body of Christ, and someone approaches you with a Pyx and asks for Consecrated Hosts
    from your Ciborium, do not provide them with the Eucharist.
    Instead, tell the person that they need to meet with the Priest or Deacon after Mass in order to receive assistance.
